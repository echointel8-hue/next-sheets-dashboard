// Per-account permission overrides layered on top of the role system —
// added per the hospital's explicit request for finer per-account control
// ("อยากให้ระบบสิทธิมีรายการย่อยให้ติ๊ก... ยังไม่มีสถานการณ์เจาะจง อยากได้ไว้
// ก่อนเผื่อใช้อนาคต"). This is deliberately a HYBRID, not a replacement: every
// account still has one of the roles below, which sets a sensible default
// for each key below (see defaultPermissionsForRole); a bootstrap account
// creating or editing an account through /manage/users can then tick a key
// on ("extraPermissions") to grant something that role wouldn't normally
// have, or tick one off ("revokedPermissions") to take away something it
// would.
//
// ROLES (see lib/auth.ts's Role type and its own top-of-file comment for
// the full story): superadmin (every department; bootstrap gets everything
// unconditionally, a regular superadmin gets a smaller default set below,
// same as before) / admin (one department, equipment-registry access by
// default) / user (booking only, the newest and most-restrictive role,
// added later per the hospital's explicit request — no equipment-registry
// access by default). There used to be a fourth role, "it" (every
// department, read-only equipment-registry access + the technical
// /manage/it dashboard + booking-resource management) — folded into
// "superadmin" per a later explicit request ("นำสิทธิ it ออกไป และนำ
// ความสามารถในสิทธิ it ไปรวมกับ superadmin"): its two defining keys,
// accessItDashboard and manageBookingResources, moved out of
// NON_GRANTABLE_KEYS below so any superadmin account can now be granted
// them per-account, but neither became an automatic default for every
// superadmin — an explicit later choice not to silently change what every
// existing superadmin account can do.
//
// Dependency-free "pure module", same convention as lib/booking.ts and
// lib/roleLabel.ts (only a type-only import from lib/auth.ts, never the
// crypto-importing runtime code) — so this can be imported directly by
// client components (UserFormModal's checkboxes) as well as every server
// route and lib/auth.ts/lib/booking.ts, without pulling `crypto`/
// `googleapis` into client bundles.
//
// HIERARCHY CAP (added right after this feature first shipped, in response
// to the hospital noticing an admin account could otherwise be ticked all
// the way up to look exactly like a superadmin, making the role dropdown
// itself meaningless) — two layers, both enforced server-side (the real
// boundary, in /api/manage/users) and client-side (so UserFormModal's
// checkbox list never even offers something the server would reject):
//   1. A handful of keys — deleteEquipment, manageUsers,
//      manageReportActionList, viewAllMaintenanceTasks — stay reserved to
//      the literal bootstrap account and can never be granted to anyone
//      else via extraPermissions, full stop, even to a superadmin. See
//      NON_GRANTABLE_KEYS below.
//   2. On top of that, a role can have its own narrower allow-list for
//      everything NOT in that reserved set — currently "admin" (narrowed to
//      addEquipment + approveCarBooking, since the full "superadmin ทั่วไป"
//      tier — approveCarBooking, editBookingData, cancelAnyBooking,
//      manageEquipmentAllDept, addEquipment, disposeRestoreEquipment — was
//      still enough to make an admin account indistinguishable from a
//      superadmin) and "user" (narrowed to accessEquipmentRegistry alone,
//      the one capability the hospital explicitly asked to make optional
//      for this role). See GRANTABLE_EXTRA_KEYS_BY_ROLE below.
// isGrantablePermission(key, role) is the one function that combines both
// layers — always use that, never NON_GRANTABLE_KEYS or
// GRANTABLE_EXTRA_KEYS_BY_ROLE directly.
//
// NOT every existing role check in the app was migrated to read through
// here — only the ones listed below, chosen because they're reasonable,
// low-risk things a hospital admin might plausibly want to grant/revoke per
// account. One narrower rule was deliberately left as a plain role check
// because turning it into a togglable key would risk changing behavior in a
// way nobody asked for: a superadmin's own reach (every department,
// unconditionally) never depends on a permission key at all — see
// canAccessEquipmentRegistry in lib/auth.ts and the "manageEquipmentAllDept"
// checks in /api/manage/records*, both of which special-case
// role === "superadmin" before ever consulting hasPermission().

 * always allowed — this only blocks *granting* one of these keys to an

 * when they were the old "it" role's exclusive default) — moved out per the
